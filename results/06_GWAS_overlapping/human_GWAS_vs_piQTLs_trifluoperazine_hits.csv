5780,9,264604,3.735167919418324,YIL048W,NEO1,"""Phospholipid translocase (flippase) ; role in phospholipid asymmetry of plasma membrane; involved in endocytosis ; vacuolar biogenesis and Golgi to ER vesicle-mediated transport; localizes to endosomes and the Golgi apparatus"""
1923,4,608355,3.0198877271443094,YDR081C,PDC2,"""Transcription factor for thiamine-regulated genes; required for expression of the two isoforms of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1 and PDC5) along with thiamine biosynthetic genes; binds a DNA sequence in the PDC5 promoter; mutant fails to grow on 2% glucose and thus is scored as inviable under standard conditions"""
369,2,191124,3.824732435014252,YBL017C,PEP1,"""Type I transmembrane sorting receptor for multiple vacuolar hydrolases; cycles between the late-Golgi and prevacuolar endosome-like compartments"""
