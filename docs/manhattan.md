## Description

__Manhattan plots__ are showing the location of piQTLs along the entire yeast genome. 
piQTLs are defined as peaks that pass by the thresold shown by the blue line. 

__QQ plots__ (for quantile-quantile plot) is a probability plot, that show the comparison between the expected and the experimental p-values resulting from the association tests that compare the variance of the quantity of PPI complexes and between the different type of genotype.

*The graphs are interactive.*


## Instruction

For loading the piQTLs from a specific PPI under a specific drug, select your PPI of interest and your drug of interest by selecting them from the choice boxes.
